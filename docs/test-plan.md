# Test Plan

## Component Tests

### CreatePost Component
- Should render the form with empty fields initially
- Should display validation error when submitting without title
- Should display validation error when submitting without content
- Should call OpenRouter API when clicking "Generate" button
- Should show loading states during content generation
- Should handle API errors gracefully
- Should successfully create a post with valid inputs
- Should navigate to home page after successful post creation

### ViewPost Component
- Should show loading state while fetching post
- Should display 404 message for non-existent posts
- Should render post content correctly with markdown formatting
- Should sanitize HTML content properly
- Should display post metadata (author, date) correctly
- Should handle API errors gracefully

### Home Component
- Should show loading state while fetching posts
- Should display empty state when no posts exist
- Should render list of posts with correct metadata
- Should handle API errors gracefully
- Should sort posts by creation date
- Should navigate to correct post when clicking on a post

### TestAI Component
- Should test OpenRouter API connection successfully
- Should handle API errors gracefully
- Should show appropriate loading states
- Should display success/error messages via toast

## Utility Tests

### Markdown Utils
- Should format markdown to HTML correctly
- Should sanitize HTML to prevent XSS attacks
- Should handle edge cases (empty string, malformed markdown)
- Should strip markdown formatting correctly

### Toast Utils
- Should create toast notifications with correct types
- Should handle auto-dismiss functionality
- Should stack multiple toasts correctly
- Should remove toasts after timeout

### Error Monitoring
- Should capture and format error information correctly
- Should include component stack in error reports
- Should handle different error types appropriately

## Integration Tests

### Database Operations
- Should create posts successfully
- Should retrieve posts with correct data
- Should handle database errors gracefully
- Should maintain data consistency

### OpenRouter Integration
- Should connect to API with correct credentials
- Should handle rate limiting
- Should process API responses correctly
- Should manage API errors appropriately

### Routing
- Should navigate between pages correctly
- Should handle invalid routes
- Should preserve state during navigation
- Should handle route parameters

## End-to-End Tests

### Post Creation Flow
1. Navigate to create post page
2. Enter post title
3. Generate content via AI
4. Save post
5. Verify post appears on home page
6. View created post
7. Verify content and formatting

### Error Handling Flow
1. Test offline behavior
2. Test API failure scenarios
3. Test database connection issues
4. Verify error boundary functionality

## Performance Tests

### Loading Performance
- Measure initial page load time
- Evaluate code splitting effectiveness
- Monitor bundle size
- Check render performance

### API Performance
- Measure API response times
- Test concurrent API calls
- Evaluate caching effectiveness

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - Component render tests
   - Database operation tests
   - Error handling tests
   - Markdown sanitization tests

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Integration tests
   - Toast functionality tests
   - Navigation tests
   - API error handling tests

3. **Lower Priority**
   - Performance tests
   - Edge case scenarios
   - Accessibility tests
   - Mobile responsiveness tests

## Testing Tools

- **Unit/Integration Tests**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **End-to-End Tests**: Playwright
- **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse
- **Coverage Reports**: Vitest coverage

## Setup Instructions

1. Install testing dependencies:
```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event @playwright/test
```

2. Configure test environment in `vite.config.ts`
3. Create test setup files
4. Set up CI pipeline for automated testing

## Best Practices

1. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
2. Use meaningful test descriptions
3. Test behavior, not implementation
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Maintain test isolation
6. Keep tests focused and specific
7. Use proper cleanup in tests
8. Write maintainable test code
