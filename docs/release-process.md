# Release Process and CI/CD Workflow

## Overview

Our release process is designed to ensure code quality and provide proper oversight before changes reach production. This document outlines the stages, requirements, and safeguards in place.

## Branching Strategy

```
main (production)
  ↑
release/*
  ↑
develop
  ↑
feature/*
```

- `main`: Production branch, contains stable code
- `release/*`: Temporary branches for release candidates
- `develop`: Integration branch for feature development
- `feature/*`: Individual feature branches

## Release Process

1. **Feature Development**
   - Create feature branch from develop
   - Implement changes
   - Submit PR to develop
   - Requires code review approval
   - Must pass all tests

2. **Release Preparation**
   - Create release branch from develop
   - Version bump and CHANGELOG update
   - QA testing and validation
   - Security scans
   - Performance testing

3. **Release Approval**
   - Submit PR from release to main
   - Requires approval from:
     - Technical Lead
     - Product Owner
     - QA Lead
   - Must pass all validation checks

4. **Deployment**
   - Automated deployment to staging
   - Manual verification
   - Production deployment only after approvals

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages

1. **Validate**
   - Lint code
   - Type checking
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Code coverage
   - Security scanning

2. **Release**
   - Create release branch
   - Update version and CHANGELOG
   - Create GitHub release
   - Required approvals
   - Release notes generation

3. **Deploy**
   - Build production assets
   - Deploy to staging
   - Run smoke tests
   - Deploy to production
   - Health checks

## Safeguards

1. **Branch Protection Rules**
   - Protected branches: main, develop, release/*
   - Required reviews: 2
   - Required status checks
   - No direct pushes
   - No force pushes

2. **Required Checks**
   - All tests passing
   - Code coverage threshold met
   - No security vulnerabilities
   - Linting passes
   - Type checking passes

3. **Environment Protection**
   - Production deployments require approval
   - Staging deployments automated
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Secrets management

4. **Monitoring**
   - Deployment tracking
   - Error monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - User impact analytics

## Implementation Details

The release workflow is implemented in `.github/workflows/release.yml` with the following key features:

1. **Release Branch Creation**
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches: [develop]
     workflow_dispatch:
       inputs:
         version:
           description: 'Release version'
           required: true
   ```

2. **Approval Gates**
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     release:
       environment: release
       needs: [validate]
       if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
   ```

3. **Validation Steps**
   ```yaml
   steps:
     - name: Run Tests
     - name: Security Scan
     - name: Performance Check
     - name: Approval Check
   ```

4. **Deployment Protection**
   ```yaml
   deploy:
     environment:
       name: production
       url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.url }}
     needs: [release]
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**
   - Semantic versioning
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Meaningful branch names
   - Clean git history

2. **Code Review**
   - Review checklists
   - Documentation updates
   - Test coverage
   - Performance impact

3. **Release Management**
   - Release planning
   - Change documentation
   - Rollback procedures
   - Stakeholder communication

4. **Monitoring**
   - Pre/post deployment checks
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring
   - User feedback
