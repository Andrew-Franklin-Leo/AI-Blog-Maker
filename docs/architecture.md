# Blog Platform Architecture Design

## Overview
Single Page Application for managing and displaying AI-generated blog content with focus on authenticity and transparency in personal branding.

## Core Components

### Frontend (SPA)
- React-based Single Page Application
- Component-based architecture for modular development
- Responsive design for multi-device support

### AI Integration
- OpenRouter API integration for content generation
- Models: Only free-tier models to be used
- Content Types: Blog posts, summaries, metadata

### Database Design
Two options evaluated:

1. Supabase:
   - PostgreSQL-based
   - Built-in authentication
   - Real-time capabilities
   - Row Level Security

2. MongoDB:
   - Document-based structure
   - Flexible schema
   - Easy scaling
   - Rich querying capabilities

### Data Models

```javascript
// Blog Post Schema
{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  content: string,
  aiModel: string,      // Which OpenRouter model generated this
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp,
  metadata: {
    tags: string[],
    category: string,
    readTime: number
  }
}
```

## Technical Decisions

### Why SPA?
- Single page architecture reduces server load
- Improved user experience with faster page transitions
- Simpler deployment and hosting options

### Database Selection
Recommendation: **Supabase**
- Better suited for relational data
- Built-in authentication and authorization
- Real-time capabilities out of the box
- Free tier is generous for initial deployment

### Security Considerations
- OpenRouter API keys stored securely
- Client-side only architecture with no sensitive backend
- Database access controlled through Supabase RLS policies

## Implementation Plan

1. Frontend Setup
   - Initialize React project
   - Set up routing and state management
   - Create core components

2. Database Integration
   - Set up Supabase project
   - Implement data models
   - Create access policies

3. AI Integration
   - OpenRouter API setup
   - Model selection and integration
   - Content generation workflow

4. Testing & Deployment
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration testing
   - Deploy to static hosting

## Technical Stack

- Frontend Framework: React
- Database: Supabase
- AI Provider: OpenRouter
- State Management: React Context/Redux
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Build Tool: Vite

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of components
- Optimistic UI updates
- Caching of AI-generated content
- Efficient database querying

## Scalability

The architecture is designed to scale with:
- Increased user load
- More content generation
- Additional AI models
- Extended feature set

## Next Steps

1. Create project boilerplate
2. Set up development environment
3. Implement core features iteratively
4. Test and deploy MVP
